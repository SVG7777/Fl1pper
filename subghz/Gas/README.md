With this file you will be able to modify gas station signs around your place.
NOTE: Not every gas station have the same system, with my test i was able to succeed on 8/10 signs. This frequency is pretty common in EU.


1.) First of all be near the sign, Flipper have good trasmission so you can test in a safe distance, run the mod .sub file and when you see the sign blink you can start modify.

2.) Run the numbers you want to put on the sign, it write from left to right. You use the numbers provided in gas folder.

3.) Press again mod sub file for save and go on on the next numbers on the sign, modify the value as u wish (step 2) then press again mod file.


If you succeed you will see the sign blinking for few seconds then shutdown and light back with your modification. reset.sub is made for set the entire group to 0
